    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Guitar Building ------------------ Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCjMQSwJFqE">video example</a> of one of my earliest guitar body builds.</li>
      <li>Music Production</li>
      <li>Songwriting</li>
      <li>Guitar Playing ------------------- Here is a basic chord progression with a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferson-scott/am-g-f-updated-outro-and-guitar-cuts-at-400-and-1k"> guitar solo</a> I wrote and produced.  It's really monotonous for the first 1:24. I'm leaving room for vocals. The guitar solo starts at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferson-scott/am-g-f-updated-outro-and-guitar-cuts-at-400-and-1k#t=1:24">1:24.</a>  Check it out.</li>
      <li>Assembling audio effects --------  I use PCBs from various sources to assemble modified clones of vintage effects. Here is an audio snippet of a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferson-scott/fuzz-face-70s-clone-ggg-build">modified 70's Fuzz Face style pedal.</a>  This is a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferson-scott/phase-45-clone-demo-ggg-build">phaser clone</a> based off of the Phase 45.  At <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferson-scott/phase-45-clone-demo-ggg-build#t=0:42">42 seconds</a> in the clip I set the rate at full speed. Check it out. </li>
